# BioScatter
BioScatter is a low-power sweat sensing system, which consists of a BioScatter tag and a USRP reader with a laptop. This repository includes three parts: 1) the BioScatter tag's hardware design files (circuit schematic, PCB file, and the program for MSP430 MCU); 2) the BioScatter reader's data collection program (reader.grc) and the data analysis program; 3) a voltage monitoring experiment video.
