### Running demo

The folder <Minimal System> contains two data files, two MATLAB function files (<funcCutProfile.m>, main.m), and one main function (<Main1.m>). These files can be opened with MATLAB. The steps to run are simple:

<pre><code>"Open Main1.m,; click the Run button; the program will display the IV profiles of urea acid and ascorbic acid with different concentrations, as well as the sensing accuracy result hotmap."</code></pre>
